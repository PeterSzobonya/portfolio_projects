# Tron Game

This project was my last assignment at the end of my third university term. The game has a menu for easy navigation. The game is inspired by the movie Tron. It is the bike race in a 2d game. The bikes are represented as arrows which can be selected by the players as well as the arrows colors. 
The game area is generated randomly and in the process the pattern is checked so the two players can always meet.
The games aim is to get the other player crash into your trail so his bike would break. When this happens the game ends and a victory screen appears.
The game has a statistical section where the best players records are kept.
