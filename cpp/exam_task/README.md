# Exam task

The exam task is again from a friend of mine. It comes from a Brittish university. The task was to complete, correct and expand the given code. The core of the task was to process Amino acid chains and calculate the proteins fold index value. When the values are calculated and sorted they are written into a new ordered file.
The code had intentional errors so it would feel more like a work project. So I had to spot the errors and correct them while implementing a new feature to the base code.
